- Figure out how to write some sort of "listener" each time when the user changes date from the Date Picker

- Get and Set date for each entry of DÃ©pense Quotidienne :
	+ If in that date no entry exists, then keep the table empty
	+ If in that date there is already something, then show all the datas involved that date
	+ Auto : show the entry of the current date

- Create the corresponding panel for other types of data (DataFlux, DataEco)
