- REMEMBER : when using Database Simulator, I don't really have to write real shit, all I need is just some codes to make it work, and to understand the principle.
- ANOTHER  : without real Database, I use object and vector to save traces, but when I apply a database, I just have to save SQL INSTRUCTIONS, such as
"insert ... to..."'
"del...from..."
"update...set...where..."

Just that. And everything will be fine. 

Until now, my soft is ok. Except the fact that when user erases some datas, I "forgot" to tell that to Database Simulator, therefore it keeps everything in itself.
I will figure out how to make it work. After a nap. 

- Create the corresponding panel for other types of data (DataFlux, DataEco)
