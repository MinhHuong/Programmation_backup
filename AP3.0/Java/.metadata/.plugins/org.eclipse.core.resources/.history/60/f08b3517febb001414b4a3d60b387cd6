- REMEMBER : when using Database Simulator, I don't really have to write real shit, all I need is just some codes to make it work, and to understand the principle.
- ANOTHER  : without real Database, I use object and vector to save traces, but when I apply a database, I just have to save INSTRUCTIONS SQL, like
"insert ... to..."'
"del...from..."
"update...set...where..."

Just that. And everything will be fine.
