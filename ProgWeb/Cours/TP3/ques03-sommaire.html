	<h2>THORIN II OAKENSHIELD</h2>
	<p>
		Thorin II, also called the Oakenshield, King under the Mountain or the Mountain King,[1] was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of the Five Armies.<br>
		Before he died, he made his peace with Bilbo by commending the Hobbit's bravery and good character, apologising for his harsh words as he now recognised his comrade's fundamentally benevolent motives. His last words are, "If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. But, sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell."
	</p>

	<h2>BILBO BAGGINS</h2>
	<p>
		Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit, and the main protagonist in The Hobbit. He was hired by Thorin and Company to be their burglar on the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote of his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his nephew Frodo Baggins after his father, Drogo Baggins, ended up drowning in the Brandywine River. Bilbo was the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large and one of the few to visit the The Undying Lands.<br>
		He has found and lost his heart during the quest to Erebor.

	<h2>GANDALF THE GREY</h2>
	<p>
		Gandalf (Quenya; IPA: [gand:alf] - "Wand-Elf") the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, also named originally Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin] - "Dreamer" or "Of Dreams"), Tharkun (by the Dwarves), and Mithrandir (Sindarin IPA: [miˈθrandir] - "White Pilgrim" or "Gray Wanderer"), was a wizard, or Istar, sent by the West in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin and his company to reclaim Erebor from Smaug, convoked the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.<br>
		Four years after the ring was destroyed, Gandalf spent some time with the "moss gatherer" Tom Bombadil, then, after having spent over 2,000 years in Middle-earth, departed with Frodo, Galadriel, Celeborn, Bilbo, Elrond, (and presumably Shadowfax) across the sea to the Undying Lands, and was never seen again in Middle-earth.

	<h2>THRANDUIL</h2>
	<p>
		Thranduil, son of Oropher, was an Elven king who ruled over the Woodland Realm in the Second and Third Ages. Though inherently cautious, he eventually committed his kingdom to fighting Sauron in the War of the Ring. He was also the father of the elven prince of Mirkwood, Legolas, who was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.<br>
		After the fall of Sauron, Thranduil fixed the southern boundary of his realm as the Mountains of Mirkwood, and his realm flourished well into the Fourth Age.[10] He may have stayed on as the king of the Great Forest or left Middle-earth and departed to the Undying Lands.
	</p>

	<h2>GALADRIEL</h2>
	<p>
		Galadriel was the co-ruler and Lady of Lothlórien along with her husband, Lord Celeborn. Neither she nor Celeborn took royal titles as they saw themselves as guardians of Lothlorien.<br>
		She was the only daughter and youngest child of Finarfin, prince of the Ñoldor and of Eärwen, whose cousin was Lúthien. Her elder brothers were Finrod Felagund, Angrod, and Aegnor.[2] Galadriel was a niece of Fëanor, one of the most important elves of the First Age.<br>
		She was one of the greatest of the Eldar in Middle-earth, and surpassed nearly all others in beauty, knowledge, and power. She was also the bearer of Nenya, one of the three Elven rings. Tolkien thought of her, along with Gil-galad the Elven-king, as one of the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves left in Middle-earth.
