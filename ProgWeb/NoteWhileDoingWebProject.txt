NOTES WHEN REALIZING PROJECT :

- When using the tag <form>, in event handler jQuery, set return false so the form doens't automatically refresh, which causes the lost of all the effects of jQuery

- To include Bootstrap Glyphicon correctly, download the separate file bootstrap-glyphicons.css, use <link> tag as like include a css file, then in the .css file, add this @import url("../css/bootstrap-glyphicons.css");

- resources interpreted as...but text/plain ==> open regedit, go to HKEY_ROOT_CLASSES ==> .js ==> Content Type : text/plain ==> change to text/application

- fire onchange event on input[type="file"] if you want to load that file and do some stuff to it

- Set all the input[type="radio"] the same name, so it will allow only one selection between input[type="radio"] of the same name

- TEXT ALIGN WORKS ON ALMOST ANY KIND OF ELEMENT. OH SWEET LORD. SUCCUMB TO THE POWER OF HTML.

- JUST TO QUOTE AND POINT THIS OUT:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3. if you're using fseek() to write data to a file, remember to open the file in "r+" 
mode, example:

  $fp=fopen($filename,"r+");

DON'T open the file in mode "a" (for append), because it puts
the file pointer at the end of the file and doesn't let you 
fseek earlier positions in the file (it didn't for me!). Also, 
don't open the file in mode "w" -- although this puts you at 
the beginning of the file -- because it wipes out all data in 
the file.

Took me half a day to figure :/

- $().trigger("event") --> invoke the function for that event
